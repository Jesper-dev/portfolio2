          My name is <em>Jesper Pettersson</em> and I'm from{" "}
          <strong>Sweden, Uppsala</strong>. I'm currently working at{" "}
          <strong>Caspeco AB, Uppsala</strong> and have been working there for 1
          year. My interests include movies, reading, cooking and of course
          programming. I love to do all kinds of different projects but the ones
          that challenge me and makes me become a better webdeveloper are my
          favourites. I enjoy working in teams but working alone is also an
          option.
          <br /> <br />
          Feel free to contact me through my socials or send me an email. I'm
          confident we can make something awesome together!
